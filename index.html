                <p>Water is the primary and essential need of every living organism. It is the most precious gift by nature
                    that helps in survival. 70% of our body is filled with water, which is why it is an essential part of
                    our life. Water is needed for various purposes every day.It is a transparent, odorless, tasteless
                    liquid, and a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

                        <p>An underwater environment is a environment of, and immersed in, liquid water in a natural or
                            artificial feature (called a body of water), such as an ocean, sea, lake, pond, reservoir,
                            river, canal, or aquifer. Some characteristics of the underwater environment are universal, but
                            many depend on the local situation.Marine life can be roughly grouped into autotrophs and
                            heterotrophs according to their roles within the food web: the former include photosynthetic and
                            the much rarer chemosynthetic organisms (chemoautotrophs) that can convert inorganic molecules
                            into organic compounds using energy from sunlight or exothermic oxidation ...</p><a
